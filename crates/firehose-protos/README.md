# Verifiable Extraction Protocol Buffers in Rust

This module provides Rust implementations of StreamingFast's Firehose protocol buffer
definitions, enabling efficient encoding and decoding of data for Ethereum blockchains via StreamingFastâ€™s framework for streaming blockchain data.

## Protobuffer definitions

### [`block.proto`](https://github.com/streamingfast/firehose-ethereum/blob/335607aac766f9f3c6946d8b1ad3c8e36ab70930/proto/sf/ethereum/type/v2/type.proto)

Representation of the tracing of a block in the Ethereum blockchain.

### [`sol_block.proto`](https://github.com/streamingfast/firehose-solana/blob/develop/proto/sf/solana/type/v1/type.proto)

Representation of the tracing of a block in the Solana blockchain.

### [`bstream.proto`](https://github.com/streamingfast/bstream/blob/develop/proto/sf/bstream/v1/bstream.proto)

`Block` type from the Streamingfast block streaming Handlers library. Lower level building block of dfuse.

## Usage

To ingest these block types from flat files, check out
[`veemon/crates/decoder`](../decoder/index.html).

For a high-level Rust client to use with Firehose endpoint providers like Pinax or StremaingFast,
