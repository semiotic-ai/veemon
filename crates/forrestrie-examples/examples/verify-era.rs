//! In this example, we verify a complete era of both beacon blocks and execution blocks.
//! We first fetch a complete era of beacon blocks (8192 beacon blocks), compute the associated historical summary and
//! compare it against the historical summary from a current consensus stated. We also extract the
//! execution block headers and block numbers from the beacon blocks. We then fetch the execution
//! blocks using the extracted block numbers and verify the execution block data against the
//! extracted block headers.
